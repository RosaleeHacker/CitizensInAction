			<p><span style="color:white; font-size:22px; font-family:Impact">POACHING:</span> Poaching is the illegal act of hunting and killing animals that are protected by law. Third world countries do not have laws against poaching because it brings in money for the country that they could not have earned any other way. Places like Africa and India, which don't have laws against poaching, see rapid declines in exotic animals populations. Poachers ususally don't have a license to hunt and use illegal weapons for their hunting. The more rare the animal, the more it's assets are worth. When animal species become endangered, poachers recieve more money for poaching. The market has turned into a disrespect for all animal populations and a greed for money. As the market for ivory and fur grows in value, animal populations drop until the species are extinct.</p>
			<p><span style="color:white; font-size:22px; font-family:Impact">UNDERGROUND BLACK MARKET:</span> The underground market for the buying, selling and trading of animals is huge. The illegal trade is the 2nd largest trade volume in the world, ranking in $20 billion. The process usually includes the kidnapping of protected animals, selling them to	illegal animal enterprises who distribute the animals all over the world to buyers. Of all animals that are kidnapped, only 1% survive the transportation period. They are treated in disgusting conditions, often lethal. To make up for this loss, other parts of the ecosystem are taken and transported with the animal. The trade is biggest out of third world areas, including Africa, India and Eastern Asia because of their habitat for exotic, rare animals. All species live on a food chain and depend on each other for survival, which works perfectly when creatures are consumed at a moderate level. When that chain is distrubed, or aspects are completely removed, the chain is completely thrown off which harms all levels of the process. </p>
