			<p><span style="color:white; font-size:22px; font-family:Impact">AWARENESS:</span> The awareness of endangerments have caused major reform in the way exotic animals are protected.</p> 
				<ul> 
					<li>By enforcing strict laws and adding layers of protection against endangered animals, Nepal has lowered their precentage of poaching down to zero. Not a single rhino, elephant or tiger has been killed. </li>
					<li>U.N. Government has created court orders that hault Japan from Antarctic Whaling. This was caused by a direct corrulation in the loss of whale populations from comerical and overfishing.</li>
					<li>In an effort to protect wildlife, California banned hunting with guns and ammunition.</li>
					<li>President Barack Obama has launched many major policies to cut back on pollution, establish parks to protect animals and ban the exposure of harmful elements to wildlife.</li>
					<li>Countries enforce many laws to protect certain animals so they have a chance to recover from being endangered. Puerto Rico created a law to protect leatherback turtles and gorillas are protected in New Congo National Parks.</li> 
					<li>Pesticides have been banned in the U.K. in response to the bee scare and chemical runoff.</li>
					<li>France, Australia and South Korea have established shark sanctuaries and banned the selling and transportation of shark fins.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>The amount of progress humans have made to reverse the effects of poaching and killing is incredible. Everyday, more and more stories appear of animal rights and repopulations.</p>
