			<p><span style="color:white; font-size:22px; font-family:Impact">MY MISSION:</span> Animals are treated more as objects for profit rather than incredible creations from Earth. Animals are majestic, beautiful, and breathtaking creatures that provide so many useful services to the world. I want to expose the truth of how animals have been abused, slaughtered and sold illegally on underground markets. When people by fur or ivory, they do not know of the poaching they are supporting by making such a purchase. It's crazy that people still continue to eat fish, even though fish populations are heading straight into extinction. I want people to know the abuse farm animals take, the ripples effects caused by certain purchases and the evil surronding the planet in the world of animals. </p>
			<p><span style="color:white; font-size:22px; font-family:Impact">WHY THIS MATTERS:</span> We humans are carnivores. Meat is a natural part of our diet, along with diary and egg products. We rely on animals for consumption, travel, care taking, clothing material and companionship. On farms, cows and chickens that are sick produce unsafe products for consumption. Animals that aren't raised properly or are slaughtered in unkept ways can lead to contaminated meat and food poisioning. An animal on it's own in the wild doesn't understand that it is being stalked down and killed by a human if it is just shot. Animals are defenseless compared to the power of humans, which makes it cruel for humans to take advantage of the helpless. We have made life so difficult for animals in need, but we can reverse the changes and bring species back to sustainable levels.</p>
