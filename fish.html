			<p><span style="color:white; font-size:22px; font-family:Impact">OVERFISHING:</span> Millions of people rely on fish to make a living. Fish are used for consumption, makeup, medicines and oils. With depleting levels of fish, the risk of losing many of these products are a reality. Overfishing is the act of taking fish out of the water from fisheries, despite warnings of fish populations being low. After populations of wildfish became dangerously low, policies were made that restrict the amount of fish that were allowed to be taken from oceans. It seems like most industries were meeting these numbers, but the truth is that fisheries were smudging their numbers, taking thousands more than there were supposted to. The Marine Protection Act was established to conserve and repopulate, but according to the UN Environment Programmeâ€™s World Conservation Monitoring Centre, only 1% of the oceans are monitored under this act. A common way to catch fish is to drag massive nets across the ocean floor, collecting all fish and coral in it's path. Fish that are not wanted from that catch are thrown back into the water, dead. </p>
			<p><span style="color:white; font-size:22px; font-family:Impact">FISH POPULATIONS:</span> Fish populations are dissapearing all over the world. Waters that used to be abundant in fish seem still and unactive. Populations in almost every single breed of fish has dropped so low that some scientists believe that populations are never going to recover. For some species of fish, only a few hundred or thousand are left in existance. In North Atlantic oceans, commercial fish, such as cod, hake, haddock and flounder populations have fallen by as much as 95%. We will start to see extinctions in fish species if fishing continues business as usual. Some scientists even urge to end all fishing so the ocean has time to repopulate. </p>
