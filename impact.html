			<p><span style="color:white; font-size:22px; font-family:Impact">OIL SPILLS & WATER POLLUTION:</span> There are many reasons for oceans being littered and too toxic for life to survive. Ships throw their litter in the water, garbage washes into the rivers from cities, factories expell their waste into oceans and chemicals are dumped illegally. Trash patches wash up on beaches and form on the ocean surface. Animals injest the trash or get caught in the heeps in which they can't escape from. Whales started washing up on shore with large pins of plastic in their organs obstruting their airflow. Garbage degreades over time, which releases harmful elements into the water. Another cause of disaster, and probably the biggest threat to marine life is oil spills. Oil spills are the accidental spillage of crude oil into oceans that are caused by errors in the matience and negligent workers. The impact lasts longer than the immediate deaths that are caused; the oil mixes with the water, attaches to coral and animals, killing them over time. The oil sits and exposes life to toxic chemicals. When stories were released about the B.P. and Exxon oil spills, instead of immediatly cleaning up, chemicals were realsed into the ocean to cover up the color so it wouldn't look so drastic. </p>
			<p><span style="color:white; font-size:22px; font-family:Impact">AIR POLLUTION:</span> The burning of fossil fuels releases billion of toxic particals into the air. Factories, cars, generators and anything that produces emits carbon dioxide and other noxious gases. The effects that can occure from breathing in contaminated air can lead to respitory problems, nervous systems, reproductive mutations and death. One of the most prevelent impacts from these toxins is global warming. The change is temperature destroys nature, disturbing ecosystems that animals rely on. Animals can't withstand the heat or die from the change in their habitat. Cold nature animals lose their snowy and icey habitats. The melting of the Arctic has contributed greatly to the loss of seals and polar bears. The other part of global warming that affects nature are the chemicals that embed into the world. The chemicals released in the air also causes acid rain which kills trees, plants and acidifies oceans, which kills fish.</p>
			<p><span style="color:white; font-size:22px; font-family:Impact">INDUSTRIALIZATION:</span> Industrializationm, which has caused for humans to progress furthur in science and technology, has negativily impacted animal species. What we have gained in learning, knowledge and tools, animals have lost in ecosystems, and forcing to relocate, or die from not finding somewhere to live. Cities are built ontop of vast ecosystems, destroying the habitat and killing the animals that are unfortunate enough to not relocate until it's too late. Industrialization emits 6.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere annually. Animals, plants and marine life can't withstand the amounts of pollution floating in the air. The toxicity levels lead to suffocation and mutation in wildlife genes. </p>
