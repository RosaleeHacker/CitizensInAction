			<p><span style="color:white; font-size:22px; font-family:Impact">CONDITIONS ON FARMS:</span> Farming, or Factory Farming, is a prime example of minimizing costs of output and maxamizing revinue. Animals are kept confined in tiny, dirty, over-crowded boxes with no room to move or ability to see light. They consume drugs that are either injected into them or fed through food. These drugs are meant to fatten them faster and keep them alive in horrible conditions that would die.
			Animals are injected with hormones to genetically alter their growth to producing milk, eggs and fresh faster than they naturally would. These animals become unmobilized because of the weight added to them. </p>

			<p>When it is finally time to be brought to the slaughterhouse, animals are beat into unconsciousness so they don't struggle on the ride. While still alive but unable to move, they slowly die through unbearable pain as they are transported. Animals that don't die from the beating have their throats slit at the house in which they suffocate until their life is over. Most are strung up by their feet stuggling through the entire process, feeling every bit of pain. </p>
